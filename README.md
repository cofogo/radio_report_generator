### User instructions
###### To process a report file:
- Place the files you wish to process into the `raw_files` directory.
- Run the executable.
- Type in the name of the file you wish to process (if you write no extension, the program will assume `.csv` by default)
- Press enter and wait for the process to end.
- In case of success, the processed file will be located in the `processed_files` directory. The name of the newly created file will be the same as the input file's but with `proc_` prepended to it.
